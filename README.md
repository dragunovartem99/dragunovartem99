# Hi there 😄

My name is Artem, I am 22 y.o.

When I was a teen, I dreamed about creating my own website.
I tried some builders like uCoz, later Wordpress.

It wasn't fun. I felt too restricted with pre-built themes and structures.

My desire is to make custom and beautiful websites, that are lightweight and minimalistic.

So in 2021 I have started to study web development by taking paid courses and watching YouTube lectures.

## Now I am working on developing this skills:
1. Clean and Semantic HTML
2. Beautiful and Flexible styling with CSS
3. Responsive Design (make your website look great on any device)
4. Web Design
5. Vanilla Javascript
6. Smart and effective code organization
